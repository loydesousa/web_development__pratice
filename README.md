# Web Development Pratice👩🏽‍💻 
- This repository will be used to showcase my practical projects from my web development classes. Here you can see my growth in HTML, CSS and Javascript, the basis of front end development. 
- I want to understand this part of the front end well and have a strong foundation for my studies of the back end.
